# Curved crease origami for planing hulls

This version of the bar and hinge model allows for simulation of curved-crease origami. 
The modification was implemented by: Steven R. Woodruff (stevenrw@umich.edu), the base bar and hinge model was written by: Ke Liu (ke.liu@gatech.edu)   

The following references give background and information on the bar and hinge model:

Updates and Newer Version of This Work:
We are actively adding new functions and debugging the simulator and the latest version of the simulator will be published on our group’s website: https://drsl.engin.umich.edu/.
